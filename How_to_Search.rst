How to Search
===============
***************
Search by Name
***************
    Once the app is opened, type a name to a specific facility and press enter. This can be the whole name or a part of it. Then suggestions to different facilities are made with information on it.

Search by code
***************
    Search by code allows a live search but only gives one result. This is the fastest way to search for a facility in the application.
