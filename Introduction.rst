Previous applications present in DHIS2 compare information from both systems but this app goes a step further by identifying conflicts and allowing super users to make necessary changes.The application also allows for presentation using charts to show conflicts in the KMHFL System and the DHIS2. This achieved using their API which acts as the systems database to store the data concerning the different facilities.
