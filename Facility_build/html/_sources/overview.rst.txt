    Facility 360 application is a DHIS2 application seeking to allow people search for facilities providing information from both KMHFL and DHIS2. Previous applications present in DHIS2 compare information from both systems but this app goes step further by identifying conflicts and allowing super users to make necessary changes.The application also allows for presentation using charts to show conflicts in the KMHFL System and the DHIS2.
